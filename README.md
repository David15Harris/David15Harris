## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a JavaScript developer with a growing interest in the world of 3D graphics, currently experimenting with Three.js to bring interactive visuals and creative experiences to the browser. This space is where I document my journey into WebGL and real-time rendering using the flexibility and power of JavaScript.

Three.js has opened up a whole new creative dimension for meâ€”literally. From building simple scenes and animations to experimenting with lighting, shadows, textures, and camera controls, Iâ€™ve been learning how to construct immersive environments that run smoothly in the browser. This repository includes a collection of demos, prototypes, and mini-projects as I explore whatâ€™s possible.

My focus is on understanding the core concepts behind 3D renderingâ€”like geometry, materials, shaders, and animation loopsâ€”while applying best practices from my background in web development. I'm also beginning to explore how 3D experiences can be integrated into modern web apps, making them not just visually engaging, but also interactive and performant.

If you're a fellow developer getting started with Three.js or just curious about 3D on the web, feel free to explore the code, fork a project, or drop by with suggestions or questions. I believe in learning by building, sharing progress openly, and creating things that are both fun and technically challenging.

Thanks for checking out the repository. I hope the projects here inspire you to experiment with Three.js or dive deeper into the world of creative coding on the web.
